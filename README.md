# **PyNatple: The Description**

This package come up to complete my undergraduate thesis under the Non-linear Algorithms for Advanced Study in near-High-resolution crustalÂ Architecture project, or NATASHA. This package designed to perform Parker-Oldenburg method, a Fourier-transform-based inversion, optimized by genetic algorithm to estimate its hyperprameter precisely.

The current dependency is still light:
1. NumPy,
2. xarray,
3. xrft,
4. That's it!

This package is still juvenile, so there are a lot things to improve and discuss.
